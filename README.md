# Swedish weather forecast
## A weather forecast website for most of Swedens cities and towns 

All of the Swedish cities along with their respective coordinates are from [Niclas Kron's Svenska St√§der `.csv` list](https://github.com/sphrak/svenska-stader/). 

The forecast is gathered using SMHI (the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute) [Open Data API](http://opendata.smhi.se/apidocs/metfcst/geographic_area.html).

Weather icons used for displaying the weather can be downloaded from [https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/).
